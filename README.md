This inventory app was made for my final project in CS 360. The goal was to build a working mobile app where users can log in and keep track of inventory items by adding, viewing, editing, and deleting them. I used Android Studio and saved the data using SQLite so it stays even after the app is closed. I designed the app to be simple and easy to use so anyone could figure it out without help.

The app has a login screen, a screen that shows a list of items, and screens for adding and editing items. I kept the layout clear and made sure buttons and actions were easy to understand. I looked at other apps for ideas and tried to design the app in a way that users would find familiar and simple. I think the design worked well because the app is easy to use and does what it’s supposed to.

To start coding, I planned out the steps using simple notes and pseudocode. I broke the app into smaller parts so I wouldn’t get overwhelmed. I reused some code and kept the screens and the database code separate to stay organized. This made it easier to fix problems and will help me in future projects too.

I tested the app by going through each screen and trying different inputs to make sure everything worked. I made sure the data saved correctly and that error messages showed up when something was wrong. Testing helped me find problems early and made the app work better overall.

One challenge I had was making sure the app didn’t crash when switching between screens and saving data. I had to do some research and try a few things to fix that. In the end, I learned a lot about how mobile apps work behind the scenes. I’m proud of the inventory features and the simple design, and I plan to use this app in my portfolio to show what I can do.
